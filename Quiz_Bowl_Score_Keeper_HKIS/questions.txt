In blood, this quantity is kept steady thanks to carbonic anhydrase  enzymes. This quantityâ€™s dependence on the equilibrium constant and a ratio of two concentrations is given by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. (*) Methyl red and phenolphthalein detect changes in this quantity. For 10 points name this quantity, the negative logarithm  of the hydrogen ion concentration, which equals 7 for pure water.
 Island arcs mark many boundaries named for this type of motion. This type of evolution results in analogous structures in unrelated organisms. This term describes the alternating harmonic series, but not the regular harmonic series. Subduction zones occur at this type of (*) plate boundary, where two tectonic plates move toward each other. For 10 points, give this term for a sequence that approaches a finite limit.
